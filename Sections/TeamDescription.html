      <p class="sectionContent"> I am Eric Prioleau, a senior computer engineering major at Clemson
University. I've always lived in South Carolina and grew up in
Hanahan. Senior year of high school, I didn't know what type of
engineering I wanted to study but I did not want anything to do with
electrical engineering. I somehow chose computer engineering (which
has a similar curriculum to electrical engineering) but have enjoyed
the things I've learned during my undergraduate years at Clemson.
Besides that, I've been active in organizations such as National
Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) and Triangle fraternity (where I am
president in both of them).

I chose Clemson because my older sister also went to Clemson and I had the opportunity to see the area before attending. In the future I hope to pursue a job as a Software Developer.</p>

      <h2 class="sectionContentTitle">Computer Engineering </h2>
      <p class="sectionContent"> Originally from Raleigh, North Carolina I decided to follow in my parentâ€™s footsteps and attend Clemson University. Early in my life I decided I wanted to be a computer engineer as I had a desire to learn how computers worked and how I could build my own. As a Clemson computer engineering student, I have an abundance of hard, yet rewarding, work to complete. When I do have free time, I enjoy socializing with friends, playing tabletop games, and working on my own programming projects. I am glad to be apart of this team and I am sure that we will create great things.</p>
